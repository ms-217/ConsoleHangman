A hangman game for the Windows CMD console with several modular elements

## About this project
This is one of my experimental projects in C#. Experimental, as in what comes out while I'm trying to learn a new language. Most of my experiments have gone down the wrong side of the hill. However, this experiment has gotten to the point where I actually feel like I shouldn't kill it with fire. Yes, there needs to be some effeciency improvements and comments entered in here and there, but this project still claims the best spot in my portfolio (in C#, that is).

## What does it do?
This program is exactly what it sounds like: a Hangman game. You run it in a console and enjoy yourself. However, there is a little more to this program that meets the eye.

### Modular Hangman "Images"
One of the features that really sets this program apart is that the text "Images" that you see while you play are actually loaded from a file that can be changed. This means you can design your own image and what is displayed at every error and whenever you win the game. This adds an interesting modular element to the application where you can add your own personal touch.

### Modular Dictionary File
This is less exciting than the modular images, but you can also select the file that contains the words to be used. This allows you to choose a custom subset of words or terms, which may help you learn those words (maybe).
